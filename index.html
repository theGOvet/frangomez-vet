    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>This mini-site is a small window into the gear, tools, and insights I rely on in day-to-day veterinary practice â€” especially as a mobile ophthalmologist and first opinion locum. Whether you're a fellow vet, nurse, or just curious about what makes the job tick, you'll find practical info, kit recommendations, and a few lessons learned on the road.

Have a look around â€” and if you're after locum cover with a special interest in eyes, don't miss the CV section.</p>
