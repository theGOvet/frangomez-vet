  <h1>The Locum Paradox: Shortage or Strategy?</h1>
  <img src="/images/locum-paradox-preview.jpg" alt="The Locum Paradox" class="feature" />

  <p>At a time when vet practices in the UK claim there’s a shortage of locums, many locums report struggling to find suitable shifts. Just yesterday, I received seven different offers via email, all for different shifts — and I had to decline them all because I'm already fully booked. It’s August, the peak of holiday season, when vets naturally need time off — and yet practices still claim they “can’t find cover.”</p>

  <p>So what’s really going on?</p>

  <p>A large part of the issue seems to stem from corporate budgeting. Many large veterinary groups have identified locum fees as a cost centre — and they’re right. But in an effort to cut costs, some have set maximum locum pay rates that are significantly below market rate. That may balance the spreadsheet, but does it support the team? Does “we couldn’t find a locum” ever reach the stressed vet on the rota who now has to stay on another week?</p>

  <p>I’ve often wondered what a staff satisfaction survey might reveal — specifically around how locum cover (or the lack of it) impacts well-being. We all know wellbeing doesn’t come from free cold pizza during practice meetings. It comes from knowing someone has your back when you’re off. When that’s missing, it shows.</p>

  <p>I fully understand that locum cover is expensive. But is it really?</p>

  <p>There’s a common misconception that all locums are equal. That’s simply not true. If a practice chooses someone inexperienced — especially someone unfamiliar with the UK system — and then fails to explain expectations or caseloads, problems are inevitable. That’s not just a locum issue; it’s a planning failure.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, a good locum can be an investment, not a cost. We often help keep the ship afloat, see cases that would otherwise go unexamined, and offer new perspectives to stagnant routines. As an ophthalmologist, I often help colleagues with tricky cases and enjoy offering informal CPD. In fact, I occasionally share practical tools and insights for general practitioners on <a href="https://frangomezvet.com" target="_blank">frangomezvet.com</a>.</p>

  <p>It’s not unusual for clients to ask if they can see me again — and be surprised when they hear I’m “just” a locum. In some clinics, I’ve returned multiple times, by popular demand. But behind the scenes, we locums still face our own challenges: no paid holiday, no employment protection, and we cover our own fees — RCVS, insurance, CPD — out of pocket. And yet, we’re also one of the easiest members of staff to part with. Try doing that with a permanent employee who’s clearly not a fit.</p>

  <p>If practices invested just a bit more into the right locums — and communicated better internally about the value we bring — the cost might be much lower than the alternative: burnout, turnover, and client dissatisfaction.</p>
