 <p><strong>By Francisco Gomez</strong></p>

  <p>Veterinary practices across the UK continue to voice a familiar concern: “We can’t find locums.” Meanwhile, many locums report a very different reality — a lack of work being offered or, more often, work being offered at unsustainable rates.</p>

  <p>Just yesterday, I received seven different locum offers in my inbox — all for August shifts. I had to turn them down. Not because I’m not working — but because I’m already fully booked.</p>

  <p>And this is August — the month when schools are closed and permanent vets across the country are desperate for time off. If ever there was a time of high demand for temporary cover, this is it. So why the disconnect?</p>

  <p>A significant part of the issue seems to stem from a shift in the mindset of large corporate groups. Locum fees — once considered a necessary cost of ensuring adequate cover — are now being viewed as an expense to be minimised at all costs. These corporations, driven by profitability targets, have introduced price caps for locum cover that fall well below current market rates.</p>

  <p>The result? Fewer experienced, reliable locums are taking these shifts. And practices are left short-staffed.</p>

  <p>Let’s be clear: holiday is a legal right. When to take it, however, is ultimately decided by the employer. So when a vet is denied time off — or worse, given time off but left to cope with the guilt of leaving an already overwhelmed team without cover — we need to ask: what is the real cost of cutting corners on locum support?</p>

  <p>It’s not just financial. It’s wellbeing. It’s retention. It’s burnout.</p>

  <h2>The Pizza Test</h2>

  <p>You know those free, cold pizzas at mandatory corporate meetings? They’ve become a bit of a symbol in our industry. Wellbeing ticked off. Box checked. But what if true wellbeing could be measured instead by how well a team is supported when someone is away?</p>

  <p>Wouldn’t it be interesting to survey how permanent staff feel about their employer’s approach to locum cover?</p>

  <p>Because while it’s easy to say “we couldn’t find a locum,” it’s not so easy for the vets left holding the fort — juggling double bookings, managing emergencies, mentoring new grads, and navigating the frustration of clients expecting continuity of care that simply can’t be delivered.</p>

  <h2>Are Locums Really That Expensive?</h2>

  <p>Let’s be honest: locum cover isn’t cheap. Nor should it be. We cover gaps in the rota without benefits, paid holiday, sick leave, or job security. We pay our own RCVS fees, insurance, CPD, and equipment. And yet, when used correctly, a good locum can make a practice money — not cost it.</p>

  <p>We bring flexibility, fresh perspectives, and a willingness to roll up our sleeves. I often offer informal CPD or ophthalmology advice to colleagues, and occasionally share practical tools and insights on my site <a href="https://frangomezvet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frangomezvet.com</a>, particularly around ophthalmology in general practice.</p>

  <p>Clients sometimes ask to book me again, only to be told, “He’s just a locum.” I’ve had repeat requests from practices I’ve covered before. That doesn’t happen by accident.</p>

  <p>But not all locums are the same. A too-cheap, inexperienced locum can be a false economy — especially if expectations aren’t clearly communicated. If no one explains how busy the practice is, what support is available, or what is expected of us, things will go wrong. And when they do, the blame isn’t solely on the locum.</p>

  <h2>More Than Just a Stopgap</h2>

  <p>Sometimes I find myself discussing complex, long-term treatment plans for patients I’ll never see again. Should that be a locum’s role? Some of us are happy doing it. Others aren’t. Either way, if continuity of care matters to you (and it should), you need to plan for that — not just hope the locum can figure it out on the day.</p>

  <p>Locums can be an invaluable resource. We can provide breathing space for permanent staff, contribute to team knowledge, and prevent burnout. Yet we’re often treated as interchangeable, dispensable, and — more recently — unaffordable.</p>

  <p>We have no notice periods. No redundancy rights. No real leverage. And we still show up, pay our fees, and fill in the gaps.</p>

  <p>Is it really so outrageous to suggest we should be paid what we’re worth?</p>
